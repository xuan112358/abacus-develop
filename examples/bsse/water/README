example showcasing how to use BSSE correction to calculate formation energy of water
STRU_0 : used along with ntype = 2;normal calculation of water molecule (E_h2o)
	 obtained total energy of -466.1225988776397 eV
STRU_1 : used along with ntype = 2;calculation of single O atom (E_o)
	 obtained total energy of -427.6271689751553 eV
STRU_2 : used along with ntype = 3;calculation of 1st H atom (E_h1)
         obtained total energy of -12.58872469295076 eV
STRU_3 : used along with ntype = 3;calculation of 2nd H atom (E_h2)
         obtained total energy of -12.58872446212924 eV

Thus, the formation energy is given by:
E_h2o - (E_o + E_h1 + E_h2) ~ -13.32 eV
